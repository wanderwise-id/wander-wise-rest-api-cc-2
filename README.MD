# Quick Look

</p>

# Authentication

This service is using firebase authentication to managing user function, firebase authentication store user data including uid, displayname, photourl, email, phone number, refresh token, and access token. With this feature we don't need to store user data to database.

In order to use POST service, user need to register and login to access it. The user will recieve access token if authenticated is valid, if you don't have there will be error message 401 (unauthenticated).

# Known Issues

* count likes where post is not specify by postId, if we have already login, we can take uid from decoded token. In this case, the idea is get all posts and count how many likes where postId is equal as idPost. WITHOUT using postId paramater like getPost by postId.
The alternative is, we need to target post with postId, and from that, we can count how many likes post they have. So in posts document, they have sub-collection likes.
